# Glimmr

A browser-native, installable progressive web application that lets anyone snap or upload a picture, see visually similar images instantly, and then remix that same photo with AI‚Äîall without leaving the page or installing a traditional app.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite) + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Vercel Edge Functions
- Image Recognition: Google Cloud Vision / SerpAPI
- Image Editing: OpenAI DALL-E
- PWA: Service Worker, Manifest

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GCP_PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
   GCP_VISION_KEY=your_gcp_vision_key_base64_encoded_service_account_json
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
   ```
   *Note: For `GCP_VISION_KEY`, you typically provide the base64 encoded content of your service account JSON key file.*
4. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
